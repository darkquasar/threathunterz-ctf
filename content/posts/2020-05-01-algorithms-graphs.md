## Undirected Graphs

### Some problems

* Path
* Shortest path
* Cycle
* Ehler tour: A cycle that uses each edge exactly once.
* Hamilton tour: A cycle that uses each vertex exactly once
    - classical NP-complete problem.
* Connectivity
* MST:
* Biconnectivity: A vertex whose removal disconnects the graph
* Planarity
* Graph isomorphism: Are two graphs identical?
    - No one knows so far. A longstanding open problem

### Example

```bash
You can think of files like nodes and folders like edges. What is the shortest path to a file?
```

### Can you decrypt me?
